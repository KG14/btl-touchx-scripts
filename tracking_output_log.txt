That's it! Feel free to play around with any of this code to get familiar with it--it's all in simulation so nothing's going to break regardless. With the functions above, you should be able to do something simple, like get the robot to move in a straight line, or do the initial writing thing I mentioned on Tuesday. Not mandatory, but could be good to get familiar with the library! Press enter to close the simulation.
